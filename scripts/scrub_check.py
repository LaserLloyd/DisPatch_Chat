"""Fail-closed scan for private data in the public tree.

This is the guarantee behind "my data never leaves". It runs six ways:

    python3 scripts/scrub_check.py                    # scan the whole repo
    python3 scripts/scrub_check.py --staged           # pre-commit: the INDEX
    python3 scripts/scrub_check.py --path DIR         # an arbitrary directory
    python3 scripts/scrub_check.py --rev SHA          # pre-push: a commit TREE
    python3 scripts/scrub_check.py --message FILE     # commit-msg: one message
    python3 scripts/scrub_check.py --commit-range A..B  # pre-push: N messages

Install the hooks that use them with `scripts/install-hooks.sh`.

Exit status is 0 only when the tree is clean. Anything suspicious is a hard
failure with the file, line and reason — it never "warns and continues",
because a warning in a publish pipeline is a leak with extra steps.

Design notes
------------
* **Deny by pattern, not by filename.** A rule keyed to `security.yaml` misses
  `security.yaml.bak`; a rule that recognises a PIN hash catches both.
* **Personal identifiers are configurable**, because the maintainer's own name
  and hostnames are exactly what must not ship, and they differ per fork. Set
  them in `scripts/scrub-rules.local.txt` (git-ignored, one regex per line) so
  a fork can add its own without editing this file.
* **False positives are expected and cheap to handle**: add an inline
  `# scrub-ok: <reason>` comment on the offending line. That marker is
  deliberately noisy so it shows up in review.
* **`--staged` reads the INDEX, not the working tree.** Those are different
  files, and the difference is exploitable: `git add secrets.py`, edit the
  secret out of the working copy, commit — the hook reads the clean working
  copy and the index still holds the secret. Every staged read here goes
  through `git show :<path>`.
* **Some rules only apply to files git is actually carrying.** A working tree
  contains a running install's avatars and generated images; git ignores them,
  so they cannot be published and flagging them would only teach people that
  this tool cries wolf. Those live in FORBIDDEN_IF_COMMITTED and fire when the
  file is tracked or staged.
* **Commit messages go through the same regexes.** They are published as
  loudly as the code is, and a message is where a path, a hostname or an
  assistant session URL gets pasted without thinking. `--message` and
  `--commit-range` reuse CONTENT_RULES rather than growing a second copy of
  them in shell, because two copies of a deny-list is one stale deny-list.
